### Introduction

Time Bank is a web service for managing a time bank, in which users offer their
time doing service in exchange for services provided by others users for the
same amount of time.

You can see a  demo of timebank here: http://timebank.wadobo.com
The project page is http://wadobo.com/trac/timebank/

### Dependencies

* Python 2.x >= 2.5
* python-virtualenv
* Has only been tested in Linux so far

Other dependencies can be installed with virtualenv.


### First installation

Here we will detail the most simple way to get the application running. For a
more detailed explanation about how to deploy a django, refer to:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/install/

First thing we need is installing the dependencies in virtualenv:

    $ ./setup_env.sh

$ Now everytime we want to use the installed virtualenv, we can do the
following within the directory containing the env/ subdirectory:

    $ source env/bin/activate

After that, we need to configure the database (we use sqlite by default):

    $ ./manage.py syncdb --noinput

That's it! Start the webserver with:

    $ ./manage.py runserver

Now you'll be able to enter to your own timebank in http://localhost:8000

Of course this is a very simple and local installation. We recomend using a
web server like cherokee, lighthttpd or apache configure to use fast-cgi and
django, and a more powerful database like postgresql. Django documentation
explains how to do that:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/install/
